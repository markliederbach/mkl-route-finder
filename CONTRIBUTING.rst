Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `route_finder` for local development.

1. Fork the `route_finder` repo on Gitlab.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone <project location>.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::

    $ mkvirtualenv dev-mkl-route-finder
    $ cd mkl-route-finder/
    $ python setup.py develop

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ python setup.py test

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to Gitlab::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a merge request through the Gitlab website.

Merge Request Guidelines
-----------------------

Before you submit a merge request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. The pull request should include tests.
2. If the pull request adds functionality, the docs should be updated. Put
   your new functionality into a function with a docstring, and add the
   feature to the list in README.rst.
3. The pull request should work for Python 2.7+, and 3.4+, and for PyPi.

Tips
----

To run a subset of tests::

    $ python -m unittest tests.route_finder.test_route_finder
